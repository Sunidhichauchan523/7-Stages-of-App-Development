# 7-Stages-of-App-Development
System application and in-app advertising is at an all-time high and many different businesses are attempting to capitalize on this wave. However, many are unaware about the proper app development process. <br>
Understanding the mobile app development stages at least in theory will help you set the right expectation for your hired team of dev elopers, know why a certain phase is critical and, be prepared for certain discussions. The following article is about the stages of mobile app development. The process starts with the project ideation and initiation and the final point is when the team releases their product. <br>
1.	Project initiation<br>
The first step is defining what you want to create, who will use it, and why. The project ideation always comes at the beginning. As soon as you will approach a mobile app development company with your request, you have to present the engagement manager with your business needs, objectives, and vision of the project. If the concept is vague and needs estimation of the market trends or target audience. <br>
During this stage, you have to ask yourself these 5 questions:<br>
•	What is the purpose of my app?<br>
•	What problems do I want to solve with my app?<br>
•	Who is the target audience of my app?<br>
•	Are there any other apps that address similar/ same problems?<br>
•	How is my app better when compared to others?<br>
•	What would make people download and use my app?<br>

2.	Analysis and Planning<br>
The next step is bringing your concept into reality. After defining the application’s objectives, the <a href="https://www.hatsoffdigital.com/services/mobile-application-development/">mobile app development agency</a> will help you in creating a project plan. Here, you will analyze apps in the market and decide on a name for your app. Just like domain names, mobile app names must be distinct for every application in an app store. 
Estimating and Planning is not just for scheduling product deadlines. They are important as they give the team a feeling of flexibility they could use later. A project plan will help the mobile app development team evaluate its resources, features, and schedules. <br>

3.	UI/UX Design<br>
A UI/UX layout includes a user-friendly interface. The first thing users will see when they open your app is not the features it offers but the way it looks and how it interacts with users. The goal of the application is to create a mobile experience that is intuitive and straightforward to use. Hence, UI/UX design is used to produce a unique user experience that is appealing, straightforward, and simple to use. You have to make sure that your app is: intuitive, simple, engaging, and does what it says it will. <br>

4.	App Development<br>
The app development process does not consist of mere coding. It is important to know in advance how much there is to do and how much time it will take up. Therefore, prior to development, tasks are always prioritized and estimated. The estimation will help the team determine the time needed to close the particular task. This time includes only the coding part and does not include the time spent on meetings, discussions, and other time spent on development. <br>
The team assigned for the project will have regular meetings with the client and a daily/ weekly report. <br>

5.	QA Testing<br>
Testing for quality assurance is a crucial element in mobile app development. It ensures the app’s stability, compatibility, UI checks, performance, and security. It also allows the development team to see if the mobile app meets the expectations and executes the goals set. Practical testing may reveal spots that require further attention and if the main features are being processed correctly. Your application must pass the following testing procedures: User experience evaluation, functionality evaluation, performance evaluation, security testing, gadget, and platform evaluation. <br>

6.	App Deployment  <br>
When the software testing is over, the code is cleared and no bugs remain, the application can be put forth for release where customers can find and use it. Before the successful launch of any application, it must be proposed and get accepted by the application stores like Google Play Application Store and Apple Application Store for Android and iOS respectively. For releasing a newly built application for public use, a developer account will be required on the application store. The metadata needed for an application’s publication in the store:<br>
•	A unique app name<br>
•	Personalized app description<br>
•	Category the app belongs to <br>
•	Keywords for easy recognition of the app<br>
•	Icon for starting the program<br>
•	Screenshots from the app store<br>

7.	Further Support<br>
When the system is deployed, software companies will also provide further maintenance of the product and help in bug fixing, code refining, and any further enhancements. The application development team will also detect any crashes and help in monitoring the app’s statistics. Your app will therefore stay attractive and adapt to any changes in the market conditions and users’ feedback. <br>

App development is an ongoing process and will continue even after the initial launch as you receive user feedback. Mobile Application Development in India can be done easily by hiring a team of expert developers. The most important thing to keep in mind is to hire a team that can lead you through the important steps of app development and also ensure the product’s integrity.<br>
